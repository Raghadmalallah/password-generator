# password-generator

## Description

For this project, I modified a starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on the criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password can include special characters, uppercase, lowercase, and Numeric, it generates 8 - 128 password length.

## Installation

I started analyzing the structure of the HTML and with the Javascript, I started adding Variables and functions and connect everything together to finish.
